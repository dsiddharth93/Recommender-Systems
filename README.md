# Recommender-Systems

1. Obtained the dataset from the website called GroupLens. The dataset consisted of movie ratings for the past 20 years.

2. Dataset had 9126 Movies across 18 genres and consisted of more than 100000 ratings by 671 users.

3. Performed exploratory data analysis in R to identify the major trends in the dataset.

4.  Developed a recommender system using collaborative filtering to provide personalized recommendations to users.

5. Utilized both Item based and User based collaborative filtering techniques to compare results across both methods.

6. Compared the models based on ROC curve and Precision/Recall curve and found that user based collaborative filtering was a better method even though it is computationally time consuming.
